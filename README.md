# SQL-HW
Creating a SQL database, tables and performing analysis on those tables 

With the Bonus section I commited the juptyer notebook with the password initially. I had a hard time trying to figure out to reverse this after the commit. However, I did edit the file in github and replaced the sensitive information with *****. But you can still see the code.
